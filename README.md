# Turtle Chomp Game
- Part of the one day codingworkshop with SheCodes Australia. Getting my feet wet with Python. Really awsome day :).

To test out the game you first need to make sure you have Python installed on your machine. 
In your terminal enter the following command, depending on your operating system:

### Mac/Linux: 
python3 --version

### Windows:
py --version

If you already have Python installed the command should return something like this: Python 3.Y.Z

If you don't have Python installed head to their dowloading page and install the latest version

Clone the repository on your machine. Open the repo in your code editor. From your command line run py kbgame.py for windows (python kbgame for Mac/Linux)
On your keyboard, use the left and right arrows to change the turtle's direction, and the Up and Down arrows to make it move faster or slower respectively. 
Game will end after 60 minutes, during which time your turtle (the green one) must chomp on the most cabbages in order for you to win the game. Have fun playing :) .
